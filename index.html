        <p class="lead">The spaces in which I teach vary dramatically, from windowless rooms with chalkboards and moveable chairs to video calls with accompanying text chats and breakout rooms. The students in my classes similarly range in their cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and their reasons for pursuing higher education.</p> 
        <p class="lead">The ways in which I interact with these students, and the digital and non-digital technologies that mediate our communication, are constantly in flux. However, some things stay the same. I am always teaching that writing is rhetorical. I am always striving to create inclusive and accessible environments that integrate technology in pedagogically sound ways. And I am always striving to take on the role of coach as I invite learners and writers to participate in communities of inquiry.</p>

I also develop professional development initiatives and recommendations in response to the assessment results.</p>
            <p><b>Program Developer, University Writing Program, UC Davis, September 2011 – June 2015</b>. Our team developed, piloted, and implemented hybrid and online versions of UC Davis’ ten-week first-year composition course. We also coordinated a training program for first-time instructors and made recommendations for assessing the program.</p>
            <p><b>Faculty Developer, Academic Technology Services, UC Davis, September 2011 – June 2014</b>. I coordinated faculty development initiatives, showcased innovative faculty, served as the Associate Editor an instructional technology blog, and served on committees that informed institutional educational technology and hybrid/online learning initiatives at UC Davis.</p>
            <p><b>Instructional Designer, University of the Rockies, June 2009 – May 2010</b>.
